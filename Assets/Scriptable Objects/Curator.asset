  suspectSummary: "Lauren Durrell, the respected curator and former intern, did show
    up earlier than scheduled for a donor meeting that no one confirmed (Valley Echo),
    and her badge was used twice that day (Writers Gazette), possibly cloned. She
    was tight-lipped in interviews (Front Page Fury), and vouched for Rick Dalton\u2019s
    temporary clearance (Scandal Sheet). But nothing in the timeline places her near
    the alarms, control panels, or exit points during the heist. She may have been
    manipulated \u2014 but not responsible."
