  suspectSummary: "Tasha Mendez appeared suspicious due to her filming privileges,
    especially since her footage placed her near a security panel (Front Page Fury).
    However, her presence was part of a school project, and the Writers Gazette revealed
    that her footage captured Rick entering a restricted area, making her an accidental
    witness, not the thief. In fact, her deleted post \u2014 \u201CWhen the halls
    whisper, film it\u201D (Scandal Sheet) \u2014 hinted at something she saw, not
    something she did. "
