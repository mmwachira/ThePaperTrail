  suspectSummary: "Jorge \u201CJinx\u201D Mendez was caught near a rear exit on a
    motion-activated camera (Scandal Sheet), and seen lingering near a control booth,
    claiming to look for a restroom (Front Page Fury). His past made him a suspicious
    figure, but no articles suggest he had access to forged documentation, system
    knowledge, or a reason to target the artwork. The Valley Echo stated he was simply
    \u201Cmeeting family,\u201D and Writers Gazette suggests he trailed Dalton, not
    leading the operation. He was near the scene, but not the architect of the heist. "
