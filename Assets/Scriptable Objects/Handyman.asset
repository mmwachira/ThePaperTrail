  suspectSummary: "Rick Dalton had access to restricted areas through a forged maintenance
    order, as confirmed in the Scandal Sheet. The Valley Echo revealed the work order
    lacked city countersignature \u2014 already suspicious. Then Front Page Fury
    pointed out that Dalton had unsupervised access to multiple wings and understood
    the alarm system wiring, allowing him to disable key security functions. Finally,
    Writers Gazette noted that his exit was never logged, meaning he could have stayed
    inside undetected during the theft. All signs point to him \u2014 and you connected
    the clues. "
